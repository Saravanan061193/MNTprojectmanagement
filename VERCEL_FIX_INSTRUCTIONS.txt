DEPLOYMENT TO VERCEL (FIXING THE NETWORK ERROR)
=================================================

The "Network Error" happens because your Website (Vercel) is on the Internet (HTTPS), but it is trying to talk to your Computer (HTTP), which is blocked by browser security.

To fix this, you must put the Backend on the Internet too.

STEP 1: DEPLOY BACKEND (RENDER)
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click "New" -> "Web Service".
3. Connect your GitHub Repo: Saravanan061193/MNTprojectmanagement
4. Render will auto-fill settings from 'render.yaml'. 
5. Scroll down to "Environment Variables" and add these:
   - Key: MONGODB_URI      Value: (Your MongoDB Connection String)
   - Key: JWT_SECRET       Value: supersecretkey123
6. Click "Create Web Service".
7. Copy the URL it gives you (e.g., https://mnt-backend.onrender.com).

STEP 2: CONNECT VERCEL
1. Go to your Vercel Project Dashboard.
2. Settings -> Environment Variables.
3. Add a new variable:
   - Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   - Value: (Paste the Render URL from Step 1)
4. Go to "Deployments" and click "Redeploy" on the latest one.

Done! Your Vercel link will now work.
